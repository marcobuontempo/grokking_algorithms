    "*<center>Greedy algorithms are an approach for solving a problem by optimising for local solutions, and so the end result should be an approximation of the true globally optimised solution. In reality, it is improbable that they provide true globally optimised solutions, but it is usually \"good enough\". This method is used for complex problems that are NP-complete and no efficient algorithms exist.</center>*\n",
